# Welcome to the News Media Bias Plus Project

## Our Mission

This project is dedicated to promoting responsible AI development and addressing critical challenges in artificial intelligence, with a special focus on media bias and disinformation. We explore the intersection of AI safety and media integrity, focusing on:

- **Bias Detection:** Uncovering and mitigating biases in AI systems and media content.
- **Disinformation Challenges:** Addressing misinformation and disinformation and its societal impact.
- **Ethical AI:** Promoting responsible use of AI in news reporting and production.

## Our Framework

Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, we analyze news articles or documents to detect and categorize different types of media bias. Our system examines:

- Topic coverage and framing
- Political leanings and sentiment
- Language patterns and tone
- Source credibility and transparency

## Key Features

- **Bias Analysis:** Compare coverage of specific topics across multiple news articles.
- **AI Safety Metrics:** Track the use of AI in document analysis and its impact on bias.
- **Disinformation Alerts:** Detect and flag potential AI-generated fake news.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore media bias trends and AI influence in journalism.

## Why It Matters

Understanding the role of AI in media bias and disinformation is crucial for:

- Promoting media literacy in the age of AI.
- Ensuring responsible AI development in journalism.
- Fostering trust in both AI systems and media institutions.
