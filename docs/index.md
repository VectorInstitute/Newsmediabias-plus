## Our Mission

The **News Media Bias Plus Project** is a leading initiative in the field of responsible AI, dedicated to advancing the understanding of media bias and disinformation through the lens of artificial intelligence. We focus on the critical intersection between AI safety and media integrity, with the goal of promoting a more balanced and transparent information ecosystem. Our key areas of interest include:

- **Bias Detection:** Identifying and addressing biases in both AI systems and media content.
- **Disinformation Challenges:** Combatting misinformation and its societal impact.
- **Ethical AI:** Advocating for the responsible use of AI in media production and journalism.

## Our Framework

By leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques, we analyze diverse media formats—including news articles, documents, and images—to detect, categorize, and mitigate various forms of media bias. Our comprehensive system assesses:

- **Topic Coverage and Framing:** How media outlets present and prioritize different subjects.
- **Ideological Leanings and Sentiment:** The underlying tone and political inclinations in media.
- **Language Patterns and Tone:** Examination of stylistic choices that influence perception.
- **Source Credibility and Transparency:** Evaluation of the reliability and openness of information sources.

## Key Features

- **Bias Analysis:** Comparative analysis of media coverage across multiple sources to highlight differences in bias and framing.
- **AI Safety Metrics:** Monitoring and assessing the role of AI in content generation and bias detection, ensuring its responsible deployment.
- **Disinformation Alerts:** Identifying potential AI-generated disinformation, including deepfakes and fabricated news.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Engaging tools that allow users to explore media bias trends and the growing influence of AI in journalism.

## Why It Matters

In an era where artificial intelligence is increasingly shaping the media landscape, understanding its role in media bias and disinformation is essential for:

- **Promoting Media Literacy:** Empowering individuals to critically evaluate news content and sources.
- **Ensuring Responsible AI Development:** Fostering the ethical use of AI in journalism and news production.
- **Building Trust:** Strengthening trust in AI systems and media institutions by improving transparency and accountability.
