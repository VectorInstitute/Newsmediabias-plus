Annotation Guidelines and Procedure","text":"<p>This framework outlines a structured approach for annotating news articles, incorporating both text and images. The process begins with human annotators labeling a carefully selected subset of the data. Once this subset is annotated, Large Language Models (LLMs) take over to expand these labels across the entire dataset. By aligning annotations with corresponding text and images, the result is a Silver Standard Dataset.</p>"},{"location":"Annotation/#2-quality-control","title":"2. Quality Control","text":"<p>To ensure the reliability and consistency of annotations, multiple quality control mechanisms are in place. Cohen's Kappa is employed to measure inter-annotator agreement, highlighting areas that may require further clarification. In addition to automated checks, human reviewers manually evaluate a portion of the annotations. This dual approach maintains the quality and accuracy of the labeled data.</p>"},{"location":"Annotation/#3-evaluation-pipeline","title":"3. Evaluation Pipeline","text":"<p>The evaluation process is designed to convert the Silver Standard Dataset into a Gold Standard Dataset.

In this context, we refer to SLMs as those with fewer parameters, typically less than 15 million, such as BERT and GPT-2. LLMs, like Llama3, Mistral, Gemma, Phi, have significantly more parameters, often in the hundreds of millions to billions. This relative difference in scale allows us to compare the efficiency to handle more complex tasks and datasets, while SLMs are more efficient for simpler tasks or environments with limited resources.</p>"},{"location":"Benchmark/#benchmarking-on-texts","title":"Benchmarking on Texts","text":""},{"location":"Benchmark/#small-language-models-slms","title":"Small Language Models (SLMs)","text":"Model Training Method Architecture Classes Carbon Emissions (tCO\u2082e) BERT-base-uncased Fine-tuning Encoder-only Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A BERT-large-uncased Fine-tuning Encoder-only Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A DistilBERT Fine-tuning Encoder-only Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A RoBERTa-base Fine-tuning Encoder-only Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A GPT2 Fine-tuning Decoder Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A BART Fine-tuning Encoder-decoder Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A"},{"location":"Benchmark/#large-language-models-llms","title":"Large Language Models (LLMs)","text":""},{"location":"Benchmark/#llama-models","title":"Llama Models","text":"Model Training Method Architecture Classes Carbon Emissions (tCO\u2082e) Llama 3.1-8B-instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, IFT Decoder-only autoregressive CausalLM Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A Llama 3.1-8B Fine-tuning Decoder-only autoregressive sequence classification Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A Llama 3.2-1B-Instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, IFT Decoder-only autoregressive CausalLM Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A Llama 3.2-1B Fine-tuning Decoder-only autoregressive sequence classification Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A Llama 3.2-3B-instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, IFT Decoder-only autoregressive CausalLM Fake/Bias/Likely (0), Real/Unbias/Unlikely (1) N/A Llama 3.2-8B-sequence classifier Fine-tuning Decoder-only autoregressive sequence classification Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A Llama 3 (70B) N/A N/A N/A 1900"},{"location":"Benchmark/#other-llms","title":"Other LLMs","text":"Model Training Method Architecture Classes Carbon Emissions (tCO\u2082e) Mistral-v0.3-instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, IFT Decoder-only autoregressive CausalLM Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A Mistral-v0.3 Fine-tuning Decoder-only autoregressive sequence classification Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A Mistral-large-instruct (IFT) IFT N/A Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A Gemma-2-9b-Instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, IFT Decoder-only, Causal LM Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A Gemma-2-9b Fine-tuning Decoder-only, sequence classification Fake/Bias, Real/Unbias N/A"},{"location":"Benchmark/#benchmarking-on-multimodality","title":"Benchmarking on Multimodality","text":""},{"location":"Benchmark/#small-language-models-slms_1","title":"Small Language Models (SLMs)","text":"Model Training Method Architecture (text-image) BERT + ResNet-34 Fine-tuning Encoder-Encoder SAFE (Text-CNN + Image2Sentence) Fine-tuning Encoder-Encoder SpotFake (XLNET + VGG-19) Fine-tuning Encoder-encoder MCAN (BERT + VGG-19/CNN) Fine-tuning Encoder-encoder FND-CLIP (BERT/ResNet + CLIP) Fine-tuning Encoder-encoder InstructBlipV Fine-tuning Encoder-encoder DistilBERT + CLIP Fine-tuning Encoder-encoder"},{"location":"Benchmark/#large-language-models-llms_1","title":"Large Language Models (LLMs)","text":"Model Training Method Architecture (text-image) google/paligemma-3b-pt-224 Instruction fine-tuning Decoder-encoder microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, Instruction fine-tuning Decoder-encoder Pixtral-12B-2409 0-shot, 5-shot, Instruction fine-tuning Decoder-encoder LLaVA-1.6 0-shot, 5-shot, Instruction fine-tuning Decoder-encoder Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct 0-shot, 5-shot, Instruction fine-tuning Decoder-encoder meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision Fine-tuning Decoder-encoder meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-11B-Vision Inference Decoder-encoder"},{"location":"Publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#journal-articles","title":"Journal Articles","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#conference-papers","title":"Conference Papers","text":""},{"location":"Publications/#media-coverage","title":"Media Coverage","text":"<p>List instances of media coverage, including articles, interviews, and mentions in popular press.
