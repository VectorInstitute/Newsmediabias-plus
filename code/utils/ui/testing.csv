(Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress)  The use and possession of marijuana is illegal under U.S. federal law, but about three-quarters of states have legalized the drug for medical or recreational purposes. The changing legal landscape has coincided with a decades-long rise in public support for legalization, which a majority of Americans now favor.  Here are nine facts about Americansâ€™ views of and experiences with marijuana, based on Pew Research Center surveys and other sources.",
2bb8697d6e,"In several of the 24 countries surveyed, rule of law issues and improving public safety rank toward the top half of the changes people say could help improve democracy in their country. And safety â€“ whether that be reducing crime, supporting law enforcement or other policies â€“ is particularly salient in some of the middle-income countries included in the survey (Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa).  In most places, though, relatively few people think that itâ€™s important to reform the justice system itself. Israel is the notable exception, where judicial system reform was the top focus for improving democracy. At the time of the survey in Israel, waves of protests in response to proposed judicial reforms were sweeping the country, and respondents were particularly focused on how implementing those reforms â€“ or blocking them â€“ would improve Israelâ€™s democracy. (The survey preceded the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and the January Supreme Court ruling that struck down the reforms.)  Rule of law",
35b67a0958,"Free and fair elections are a critical element of a healthy democratic system. And in many of the 24 countries surveyed, reforming how elections and the electoral system work is a key priority. People want both large-scale, systemic changes â€“ such as switching from first-past-the-post to proportional representation â€“ as well as smaller-scale issues like making Election Day a holiday.  Many people link these changes to greater citizen representation, whether itâ€™s because they allow people to vote more easily or because their votes can be more readily and accurately converted into representation.  But some people take it even a step further, arguing for their country to have more direct democracy. Particularly in France and Germany, where direct democracy is the second-most suggested change, people want to have more chances to vote via referenda on topics that matter to them.",
2469001b40,"Though political systems vary across the 24 countries surveyed, citizens in each call for similarly broad changes to government rules and norms. In most countries surveyed, government reform â€“ including calls for transparency, term limits and adjusting the balance of power between institutions or across levels of government â€“ are in the top three most referenced changes. While many themes cross borders, there are some very specific proposals mentioned in each country to adjust the governmental system, such as abolishing the House of Lords in the UK or establishing a Sixth Republic in France.  The need to curb the influence of special interests and combat corruption ranks in the top half of the 17 substantive topics coded, with people broadly calling to limit the financial benefits given to career politicians, control the influence of special interest groups and deal with outright corruption. Still, country specific complaints emerge, such as the influence of super PACs in the U.S. or the amakudari system in Japan.  Media reform is mentioned less frequently in most places. But in Hungary, Australia, South Korea, the U.S. and Sweden, changing the media is one of the top 10 coded topics, with complaints centering on issues like the need for a free, independent and unbiased press.",

(Azwar Ipank/Anadolu via Getty Images)  How we did this This Pew Research Center analysis on views of how to improve democracy uses data from nationally representative surveys conducted in 24 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. All responses are weighted to be representative of the adult population in each country. For non-U.S. data, this analysis draws on nationally representative surveys of 27,285 adults conducted from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023. All surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Surveys were conducted face-to-face with adults in Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland and South Africa. In Australia, we used a mixed-mode probability-based online panel. Read more about international survey methodology. In the U.S., we surveyed 3,576 adults from March 20 to March 26, 2023. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Centerâ€™s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATPâ€™s methodology. Researchers examined random samples of English responses, machine-translated non-English responses, and non-English responses translated by a professional translation firm to develop a codebook for the main topics mentioned across the 24 countries. The codebook was iteratively improved via practice coding and calculations of intercoder reliability until a final selection of 17 substantive codes was formally adopted. (For more on the codebook, refer to Appendix C.) To apply the codebook to the full collection of open-ended responses, a team of Pew Research Center coders and professional translators were trained to code English and non-English responses. Coders in both groups coded random samples and were evaluated for consistency and accuracy. They were asked to independently code responses only after reaching an acceptable threshold for intercoder reliability. (For more on the coding methodology, refer to Appendix A.) There is some variation in whether and how people responded to our open-ended question. In each country surveyed, some respondents said that they did not understand the question, did not know how to answer or did not want to answer. This share of adults ranged from 4% in Spain to 47% in the U.S. In some countries, people also tended to mention fewer things that would improve democracy in their country relative to people surveyed elsewhere. For example, across the 24 countries surveyed, a median of 73% mentioned only one topic in our codebook (e.g., politicians). The share in South Korea is much higher, with 92% suggesting only one area of improvement when describing what they think would improve democracy. In comparison, about a quarter or more mention two areas of improvement in France, Spain, Sweden and the U.S. These differences help explain why the share giving a particular answer in certain publics may appear much lower than others, even if it is the top-ranked suggestion for improving democracy. To give a specific example, 10% of respondents in Poland mention politicians, while 18% do so in South Africa â€“ yet the topic is ranked second in Poland and third in South Africa. Given this discrepancy, researchers have chosen to highlight not only the share of the public that mentions a given topic but also its relative ranking among all topics coded, both in text and in graphics. Here is the question used for this report, along with coded responses for each country, and the survey methodology. Open-ended responses highlighted in the text of this report were chosen to represent the key themes researchers identified. They have been edited for clarity and, in some cases, translated into English by a professional firm. Some responses have also been shortened for brevity.",

In this analysis, we focus on only two of these final codes: support for nondemocratic alternatives (coded in â€œOtherâ€ in the primary analysis) and change leadership. A forthcoming report will share more details on the coding process and the many other solutions people offered.",
bfd8b578b2,"When asked in an open-ended question about their top concerns regarding the large number of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico, the most commonly cited concerns relate either to the economic costs and burdens associated with the migration surge or concerns about security (22% of concerns fall into each of these categories).  About one-in-ten adults (11%) express concern for migrantsâ€™ safety and treatment. Smaller shares raise other concerns.  Economic burdens",

(Amy Osborne/The Washington Post via Getty Images)  More than one-in-five Black adults in the United States say owning a business is essential to financial success, according to a September 2023 Pew Research Center survey. While Black-owned businesses have grown significantly in the U.S. in recent years, they still make up a small share of overall firms and revenue, according to our analysis of federal data.  How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to examine the characteristics of Black-owned businesses in the United States. The analysis relies primarily on data from the 2022 Annual Business Survey (ABS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Science Foundationâ€™s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. The survey â€“ conducted annually since 2017 â€“ includes all non-farm U.S. firms with paid employees and receipts of $1,000 or more in 2021. Firms are defined as businesses â€œconsisting of one or more domestic establishments under its ownership or control.â€ Majority business ownership is characterized in the survey as having 51% or more of the stock or equity in the firm. The Census Bureau counts multiracial firm owners under all racial categories they identify with; Hispanic firm owners may be of any race. Read more about the ABS methodology.",
